# Eight Puzzle Solver

## Project Overview
This project implements an Eight Puzzle solver using three different search algorithms:
1. Uniform Cost Search
2. A* Search with Misplaced Tile Heuristic
3. A* Search with Euclidean Distance Heuristic

## Project Requirements
- Solve the Eight Puzzle using different search strategies
- Implement an object-oriented design
- Allow arbitrary initial state input
- Generate detailed search trace
- Compare algorithm performance

## Features
- Flexible puzzle solver supporting 8-puzzle and potentially extendable to 15-puzzle or 25-puzzle
- Multiple search algorithm implementations
- Interactive user interface for puzzle input
- Detailed search trace and performance metrics

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x or C++ compiler
- Standard library data structures (priority queue, etc.)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the required programming language environment
3. (Optional) Install any additional dependencies

## Usage

### Running the Solver
1. Choose the initial puzzle state
   - Option 1: Use default puzzle configuration
   - Option 2: Enter a custom puzzle configuration

2. Select search algorithm:
   - Uniform Cost Search
   - A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristic
   - A* with Euclidean Distance Heuristic

### Example Input Format
```
Enter your puzzle, use a zero to represent the blank
1 2 3
4 8 0
7 6 5
```

## Project Structure

### Recommended Classes
- `Problem`: Manages initial and goal states, available operators
- `Node`: Represents search tree nodes with parent references
- `Solver`: Implements search algorithms

### Key Methods
- `generate_successors()`: Create possible puzzle states
